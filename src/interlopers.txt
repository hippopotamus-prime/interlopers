Interlopers
version 1.2

========
Overview
========
Interlopers is inspired by the classic Space Invaders, but
expands upon that game greatly. The objective is to prevent
slowly descending waves of aliens from reaching the bottom of
the screen (by shooting them of course - how else would you
do it?). You have barriers to shield you from the aliens' fire,
but then hiding will also give them more time to advance
downwards. 

The aliens will occasionally drop money when shot, which can
be spent on weapon upgrades and special equipment in the
between-level shop. Of course, the aliens counter this with
improvements of their own in later waves...

Features
========
* Power Ups

When destroyed, the aliens will either drop money or one of
two power-ups.  One recharges your shield (displayed at the
top-right of the screen) and the other provides energy for
your special equipment (top-lef).

* Start On Any Wave

Interlopers allows you to start on any previously reached
wave (see the settings screen).  However, on later waves,
the starting weapon would be of little use against the stronger
aliens.

So, the game records what weapons and equipment were used on
every wave (separately for each difficulty level).  When
starting a new game, you automatically get the best arsenal
used in previous games.  This shows up as a penalty in the
final score.

* Special Equipment

In addition to your main weapon, you have access to a variety
of other useful items via the shop.  For example, you start
with a teleporter that sends you to a random location - useful
for avoiding enemy fire.  Other items allow you to repair
your shield or repel enemy bullets, among other things.

Special equipment requires energy to run, which is in limited
supply.  Your current energy is displayed at the top-left of
the screen, next to your money and shield.  Energy can be
restored by collecting star power-ups that the aliens sometimes
drop.

* New! - Online High Score Table

Interlopers will generate a code corresponding to your top
high score, which you can use to put your name on the online
score table at www.mobilegamelab.com.

Controls
========
The controls can be reconfigured by selecting Keys on the title
screen or from the menu, but are set up as follows by default:

Date Book    - move left
Address Book - move right
To Do List   - fire
Memo Pad     - use special equipment
Up           - fire
Down         - pause

Additionally, the stylus can be used to control player
movement.

A note on "Allow Key Events" - If checked, this allows
the OS to generate events when hard keys used by the game are
pressed.  This can cause conflicts with 3rd party software, but
is needed for some devices to function correctly (e.g. the
Treo 600's power button).


=============
Game Settings
=============
Difficulty - Controls the speed of the aliens as well as how
   often they fire at you.  On Easy mode, trade-in values at the
   shop are increased to 100%.  Nightmare difficulty doubles the
   damage of enemy fire and generates already-damaged barriers.
   High scores and starting arsenal are stored separately for
   each difficulty setting.
   Changing the difficulty does not affect games in progress.

Start Wave - Determines on which wave new games will begin.  Only
   waves that have been previously reached are available.  When
   starting new games beyond the first wave, Interlopers will
   automatically select the best weapon and equipment item that
   were previously used on the starting wave.


================
Program Settings
================
Sound Volume - Affects the volume of sounds played by the game.
   This will override the system preferences unless set to
   "System Setting".

Pen Control - Determines how the game responds to pen taps in the
   display area (but not the Graffiti area).

Confirm Retire - If checked, causes the game to ask before
   abandoning a game in progress.

Quick Restarts - If checked, causes "Try Again" to be automatically
   selected after you die.

Graffiti Control - Allows pen taps in the Graffiti area to control
   player movement when checked.  This is not affected by the Pen
   Control setting.  On some devices, it is possible that the
   Graffiti area might be detected incorrectly.

Compatibility Mode - If checked, alters some of the game's display
   code, such that it is more likely to function on all devices.
   Otherwise, faster assembly routines are used.
   On most newer devices, this option is automatically turned on
   and will not be displayed.
