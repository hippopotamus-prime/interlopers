"The \"Code\" button generates a unique 8-digit code corresponding "\

"Sound Volume - Affects the volume of sounds played by the game.  "\
"This will override the system preferences unless set to "\
"\"System Setting\".\n\n"\

"Pen Control - Determines how the game responds to pen taps in the "\
"display area (but not the Graffiti area).\n\n"\

"Confirm Retire - If checked, causes the game to ask before "\
"abandoning a game in progress.\n\n"\

"Quick Restarts - If checked, causes \"Try Again\" to be automatically "\
"selected after you die.\n\n"\

"Graffiti Control - Allows pen taps in the Graffiti area to control "\
"player movement when checked.  This is not affected by the Pen "\
"Control setting.  On some devices, it is possible that the "\
"Graffiti area might be detected incorrectly.\n\n"\

"Compatibility Mode - If checked, alters some of the game's display "\
"code, such that it is more likely to function on all devices. "\
"Otherwise, faster assembly routines are used.  "\
"On most newer devices, this option is automatically turned on "\
"and will not be displayed."

"Difficulty - Controls the speed of the aliens as well as how "\
"often they fire at you.  On Easy mode, trade-in values at the "\
"shop are increased to 100%.  Nightmare difficulty doubles the "\
"damage of enemy fire and generates already-damaged barriers.  "\
"High scores and starting arsenal are stored separately for "\
"each difficulty setting.  "\
"Changing the difficulty does not affect games in progress.\n\n"\

"Start Wave - Determines on which wave new games will begin.  Only "\
"waves that have been previously reached are available.  When "\
"starting new games beyond the first wave, Interlopers will "\
"automatically select the best weapon and equipment item that "\
"were previously used on the starting wave."


STRING ID string_keys
"A note on \"Allow Key Events\" - If checked, this allows "\
"the OS to generate events when hard keys used by the game are "\
"pressed.  This can cause conflicts with 3rd party software, but "\
"is needed for some devices to function correctly (e.g. the "\
"Treo 600's power button)."

STRING ID srting_overview
"Interlopers is inspired by the classic Space Invaders, but "\
"expands upon that game greatly. The objective is to prevent "\
"slowly descending waves of aliens from reaching the bottom of "\
"the screen (by shooting them of course - how else would you "\
"do it?). You have barriers to shield you from the aliens' fire, "\
"but then hiding will also give them more time to advance "\
"downwards.\n\n"\

"The aliens will occasionally drop money when shot, which can "\
"be spent on weapon upgrades and special equipment in the "\
"between-level shop. Of course, the aliens counter this with "\
"improvements of their own in later waves..."
